+ Reusable movement function - adjusts to length of motion and number of motors
+ Safety check function - make sure motors do not go beyond certain range
+ General shutdown function
o Cleaned up unneeded declarations and variables
o Time delay is now dynamic, relates to mov array

publisher_v2.py		18/02/2020
+ Shutdown function triggered by keyboard interrupt
+ More optimal motion algorithm - allows easier testing for different motions and addition of new motors
+ Reformatted and added comments to every section of the script to increase readability
- Removed position feedback - error is too large to be sustainable for longer motions
