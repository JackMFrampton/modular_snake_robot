Modular Snake Robot - Mechatronics Project

## PLEASE NOTE:
● Not all code / videos are uploaded. Mostly only my own personal contributions to this project is posted here

● There is also a video of the linear actuators being tested on the latest prototype, you are welcome to ask and I can send it to you

● Due to COVID-19 pandemic, this project's timeline was cut in half. Certain objectives were not fully implemented or deployed

● Because of this, the latest Python scripts are not ideal or efficient and can be improved a lot

● Despite these conditions I believe a lot was still achieved and the project shows future promise

● I have added a Demonstration Videos folder to show its current capabilities in different motion types 

### Overview
● ROS environment [Linux – Ubuntu | Embedded system]

● Dynamixel AX-12A Servos and PQ12 Micro Linear Actuator motors

● Parent-child Arduino force sensor network [ROS nodes]

● Sensor feedback and motor control [Software development | ROS nodes | Python]

● Motion Planning & 3D Pose Estimation [Kinematics | Induced sine-wave motion algorithm]

**There was also a team that worked on creating silicon skin, that utilised kirigami techniques to have scales pop out without the need of additional actuators. I did not have involvement in this aspect, but you can read about it in the report should it interest you**
