# ModularSnakeRobot
Modular Snake Robot - Mechatronics Project

## Not all code / videos are uploaded. Mostly only my own personal contributions to this project is posted here.
## There is also a video of the linear actuators being tested on the latest prototype, you are welcome to ask and I can send it to you

## NOTE: due to COVID-19 pandemic, this project's timeline was cut in half. Certain objectives were not fully implemented or deployed.
## However despite these conditions I believe a lot was still achieved and the project shows future promise
## Because of this, the latest Python scripts are not ideal or efficient and can be improved a lot
## However I have added a Video Demonstrations folder to show its capabilities 

### Overview
● ROS environment [Linux – Ubuntu | Embedded system]

● Dynamixel AX-12A Servos and PQ12 Micro Linear Actuator motors

● Parent-child Arduino force sensor network [ROS nodes]

● Sensor feedback and motor control [Software development | ROS nodes | Python]

● Motion Planning & 3D Pose Estimation [Kinematics | Induced sine-wave motion algorithm]
